Faster lolcat, since written in c.

Features:
	-About 2-5 times faster
	-Handles lines with length > terminal width better
	-Always uses truecolor

Some of the original lolcats features are missing, and depending on flags and 
where your pipes go it might have not too much more performance
due to I/O overhead (at least my terminal emulator is slow with colors).
