Faster lolcat, since written in c (even beats c-lolcat).

Features:
	-About a fucking LOT faster (more below)
	-Handles lines with length > terminal width better
	-Always uses truecolor

On my system it gives the following speedup:

$ time dmesg | lolcat -t
... (some floating point errors visible)
real 1.104s
user 0.841s
sys  0.276s

$ time dmesg | clolcat
... (no floating point errors visible)
real 0.113s
user 0.022s
sys  0.012s

When measuring performance keep in mind that on some systems 
(espicially with nouveau instead of proprietary graphic drivers)
the bottleneck might be overhead from outputting to a terminal.
