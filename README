Giant piece of shit. Wanted to make a faster lolcat, but found out during development that the bottleneck of the original lolcat isn't ruby, but how fast color changes are processed by bash/whatever. Code has like 1 comment, and most of lolcats functionality isnt implemented, but still uploading, just in case. (if you benchmark it it might appear slower that the ruby version, thats because it uses truecolor by default. if you compare it to lolcat -t it will be like 20-40% faster.)
