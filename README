Giant piece of shit.
Wanted to make a faster lolcat, but found out during development that the bottleneck of the original lolcat isn't ruby, but IO :/
Code has like 1 comment, and most of lolcats functionality isnt implemented, but still uploading, just in case.

Generally since i don't wanna update this every time i optimize something i'd say you should benchmark it yourself, but i can at least say
that the speed heavily depends on the settings. It ranges from 2.5x slower than lolcat to 50x faster, depending on where you pipe to/from and stuff.
